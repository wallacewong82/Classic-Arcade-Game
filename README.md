# Classic Arcade Game Project

This README provides the instructions to the Classic Arcade Game project for Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree course.



## Rules
The application is a simplified replica of the Frogger game, where the player needs to take his character across the road which has many enemies dashing across it. If the player hits an enemy, he/she will have the game reset, indicating a loss. If the player reaches the opposite side of the road, the game resets as well, indicating a victory. 

## Setup:
1. Download the files from GitHub repository.


2. Open the `index.html` file using your favourite browser.


3. Game will start immediately.
